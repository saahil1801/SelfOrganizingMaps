This repository contains Python code for utilizing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to detect fraud in a dataset. A SOM is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can be used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. In this case, we use a SOM to identify potential fraudsters within a dataset.

Fraud detection is a critical task in various industries, including finance and e-commerce. This code demonstrates the use of a SOM to identify potential fraudulent transactions based on the characteristics of the data.

The code performs the following tasks:

Initializes a SOM grid.
Trains the SOM with input data.
Maps data points to the SOM.
Identifies potential fraud cases.

The code will identify potential fraud cases and visualize them on the SOM grid. Additionally, it will print the IDs of fraud customers to the console.
